|LR01|     User should enters only numbers not charactors or any symbols.                                                                  |Technical |IMPLEMENTED
|LRO2|     On encountering choice "0" program should stop running.                                                                         |Technical |IMPLEMENTED                                                                            
## SWOT
* STRENGTHS
  The ultimate strength of star-delta convertor is its innovative, user-friendly and long lasting etc..
* WEAKNESSES
  Do not inlude all the operations rather have only Star-delta and Delta-Star coversion.
* OPPORTUNITIES
  The tech-based market (Circuit field) has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market.
* THREATS
  The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
  
  ## 5W's and 1H's
 ## Who
  * Students who want to solve electrical circuit related problems for their academic work.
  * Researchers and electrical engineers.
## What
