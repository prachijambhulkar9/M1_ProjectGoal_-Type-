## Identification of Problem / Challenge - 

Star_Delta Convertor is basically very required to electrical engineering students as the formulas of star to delta conversion and delta to star conversion are very lenghty and confusing. So this calculator will directly gives the values of conversion. only you need to give resistance value and its done then you will get all the converted values.

## Requirements -

## High Level Requirements -
* User must have knowledge of some electrical quantities like reistance then only he/she will able to use or get the correct output.
* User should able to select the operation.
* User should understand the operation list.
* The system of user should able to perform operation.

|HR05|	User shall be able to find division                    | Technical |	IMPLEMENTED |






## Low Level Requirements -
* whenever user enters 0 then code should able to stop running.
* user should enters only numbers not charactors or any symbols.

|LR01|     User should enters only numbers not charactors or any symbols.                                                                  |Technical |IMPLEMENTED
|LRO2|     On encountering choice "0" program should stop running.                                                                         |Technical |IMPLEMENTED                                                                            
## SWOT
* STRENGTHS
  The ultimate strength of star-delta convertor is its innovative, user-friendly and long lasting etc..
* WEAKNESSES
  Do not inlude all the operations rather have only Star-delta and Delta-Star coversion.
* OPPORTUNITIES
  The tech-based market (Circuit field) has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market.
* THREATS
  The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
  
 ## 5W's and 1H's
 
 ## Who
  * Students who want to solve electrical circuit related problems for their academic work.
  * Researchers and electrical engineers.
## What
  * Calculate the converted star_delta and delta-star values of resistance .
## When
  * Students facing a difficulty in solving the equations related electrical circuits, can use this program to conform their outputs.
  * Researchers can use it for getting a quick calculation output.
  * Comes to a great use when calculating for resistance of huge values.
## Where:
 * Students, engineers and researchers all over the world.
## How:
 * This program can be executed in a system which has Linux or Windows operating system
