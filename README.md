# Star_Delta Convertor (SDLC)

## Identification of Problem / Challenge - 

Star_Delta Convertor is basically very required to electrical engineering students as the formulas of star to delta conversion and delta to star conversion are very lenghty and confusing. So this calculator will directly gives the values of conversion. only you need to give resistance value and its done then you will get all the converted values.

## Requirements -

## High Level Requirements -
* User must have knowledge of some electrical quantities like reistance then only he/she will able to use or get the correct output.
* User should able to select the operation.
* User should understand the operation list.
* The system of user should able to perform operation.

## Low Level Requirements -
* whenever user enters 0 then code should able to stop running.
* user should enters only numbers not charactors or any symbols.

## Implementation 

* Implementation of star to delta convertor and delta to star converter is it will make electrical engineers to calculate the values of connection very easily and beacuse of which the time required for calculation will not waste and their will be no human errors in calculations. It will be very usefull in electrical engineering field.
